**2024 will be remembered as a year when Internet Archive went through an unprecedented amount of pressure:** first, publishers ramped up attacks against them, targeting the Controlled Digital Lending model and forcing the Archive to delete over half a million books. Shortly after, a series of cyberattacks hit the Archive, putting the service down temporarily and causing a data breach affecting 31 million users. In an era where education is increasingly vital, the Internet Archive has become an essential tool for accessing books, especially in areas where physical libraries are scarce or inaccessible.

In solidarity with the Internet Archive and in honor of **Aaron Swartz Day**, we are hosting a **Bookcamp event**. We invite you to share your experiences using the Internet Archive and discuss the latest books you've read. Whether it's science fiction, regular fiction, economics, or politics, all genres are welcome! Bonus points if you can share links to purchase books without DRM.

**Open culture and open access are rights. Corporations shouldn't have more freedom than the people!**

Join us on **Nov 8 at 20:00 UK time** for a friendly conversation on [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/UKPiratePartyBookCamp).

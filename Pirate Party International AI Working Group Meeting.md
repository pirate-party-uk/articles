We're excited to announce the first meeting of the Pirate Party International Working Group on AI. Join us on February 24th to collaborate on setting up this initiative. Your input and participation are invaluable as we chart our course forward.

The focus of our discussions will be on exploring AI's potential as a tool to support individual Pirate Parties and the Individual Pirates. From optimizing election campaigns to enhancing organizational efficiency, the possibilities are vast. Additionally, we'll emphasize the importance of AI ethics, safety, and bias mitigation, prioritizing responsible development and risk mitigation.

Looking forward to seeing you there! Let's shape the future of AI together.

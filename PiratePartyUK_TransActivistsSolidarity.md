In recent news, a group of passionate transgender activists in London took to the streets to make a powerful stand against the Tory government's continued attacks on trans people. The protest, which occurred on October 10th, saw protesters waving flares in the vibrant colors of the transgender flag and unfurling a banner over the iconic River Thames while marching over Vauxhall Bridge in central London.

The message was clear: "We exist: We will resist." The protesters held up various pro-trans messages, showcasing their determination to fight for their rights and existence. This demonstration came on the heels of the Conservative Party conference, during which several ministers made anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-immigration comments.

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's remarks on October 4th particularly drew widespread condemnation. Sunak asserted that the British public was being "bullied" into accepting that "people can be any sex they want to be" and claimed that "a man is a man, and a woman is a woman." These divisive comments were met with applause from his party members, MPs, and the audience.

The Pirate Party UK wholeheartedly supports the rights of transgender individuals and their struggle against discrimination. We believe in inclusivity, diversity, and equality for all, regardless of gender identity. Transphobic rhetoric and divisive politics only serve to sow discord and further marginalize vulnerable communities.

The T-Boys Club, a transmasc nightclub in London, highlighted the destructive consequences of government rhetoric, pointing to an increase in exclusion, homelessness, and violence against trans people. They stressed the importance of queer solidarity and emphasized that the fight for trans liberation is intertwined with battling a racist border regime that targets asylum seekers and migrants.

Home Secretary Suella Braverman was also criticized for her remarks about asylum seekers, and recent hate crime figures from the Home Office revealed an 11% increase in attacks against trans people. This troubling rise is undoubtedly linked to the demonization of trans individuals by politicians.

The Pirate Party UK stands with the transgender community and all marginalized groups. We advocate for a society where everyone can live as themselves, love one another fiercely, and build joyful communities where all can thrive. As the T-Boys Club post aptly reminds us, "None of us are free until we are all free." Solidarity forever.

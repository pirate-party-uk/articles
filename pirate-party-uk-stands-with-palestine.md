summary: The Pirate Party UK expresses its unwavering support for the people of Palestine in their pursuit of freedom and justice. We stand against all forms of discrimination, including antisemitism, recognizing that all systems of oppression are interconnected. Just as we condemn historical atrocities like the Holocaust, we condemn the ongoing suffering of the Palestinian people symbolized by the Nakba. We call for an end to all acts of genocide and urge the UK government and its citizens to support the boycott, divestment, and sanction of the State of Israel until it withdraws from all occupied territories.

We, the Pirate Party UK, stand united in our support for the people of Palestine as they strive for freedom and justice on their own terms.

We believe in promoting a pro-Palestine stance, while simultaneously opposing all forms of discrimination, including antisemitism. We recognize that various systems of oppression are interconnected, and we cannot address one without considering its impact on the others. Just as we condemn historical atrocities like the Holocaust, we also condemn the ongoing suffering endured by the Palestinian people, symbolized by the Nakba.

The echoes of past colonialism and empire-building reverberate in the ongoing conflict in Palestine. We adamantly oppose the subsidization of the global war machine through weapons transfers and taxpayer funding. It is a grave violation of human rights and is defined as a war crime by the United Nations when access to basic necessities like food, water, and medical aid is cut off from a population.

Our commitment is to bridge the gap that divides us from our fellow global citizens, overcoming the inhumanity of war and terrorism. We understand that atrocities persist long after the cameras and aid organizations have moved on. We emphasize the inherent value of all human life and the importance of ensuring that everyone has the autonomy to lead a dignified and humane existence.

We call for an end to all acts of genocide, regardless of where they occur in the world.

We implore the government and the people of the United Kingdom to support the call for boycotting, divesting from, and sanctioning the State of Israel until it withdraws from all occupied territories.

Our ultimate goal is to promote peace and justice for all people, regardless of their background or place of origin.
